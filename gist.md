# Regex Tutorial - Matching an Email

In this document, I will be breaking down the components of a Regex that was used to match an email address. A Regex, or Regular Expression, is defined as a series of special characters that define a search pattern (source: https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-science/regex-tutorial.)

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
