# Regex Tutorial - Matching an Email

In this document, I will be analyzing the components of a Regex expression that was used to match an email address. A Regex, or Regular Expression, is defined as a series of special characters that define a search pattern. 

## Summary

The regular expression that I will be looking at is used to match an email address: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. I am going to break this down piece by piece to explain the different parts of the regex expression, what it means, and what it is doing.
