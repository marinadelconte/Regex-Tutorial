# Regex Tutorial

## Description
The Regex Tutorial examines a regex that is used for matching an email address: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ and breaks it down into its separate components to explain each part that is making up the expression. This includes anchors, quantifiers, character classes, groupings, bracket expressions, and greedy/lazy matches.
